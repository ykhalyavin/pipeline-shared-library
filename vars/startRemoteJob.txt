This step executes a remote job and wait for its finish.
If the remote job failed the local build will fail as well.

It accepts params:
 - "credentials" - must be in format "username:apiToken"
 - "host" - must contain schema as well (http://localhost:8080)
 - "jobName" - name of a remote job
 - "jobToken" - "Authentication Token" of a remote job
 - "params" - Groovy "Map" with pairs "key: value" which will be passed to the remote job

Example of the call:

startRemoteJob(
    credentials: "testuser:a74e0d01612bc4c7128fadcda97a90b4",
    host: "http://localhost:8080",
    jobName: "test",
    jobToken: "test_token",
    params: [
        p1: "test value"
    ]
)
